This is the FutureBB automatic tag closing extension.

If you type something like this in:
```[b]bold [i]italic```
and then just type in "[/", it will automatically close the tag for you with the "[/i]", and if you do that again, it will add "[/b]" to close the whole thing.

Requirements:
FutureBB Version: 1.4
